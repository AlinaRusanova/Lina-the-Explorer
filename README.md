# Lina-the-Explorer
Meet Lina! This girl is obsessed with traveling. The way she travels is unusual - her journey begins not from the moment she comes out of a bus/train, but much earlier - from the moment she comes to the road. She uses magic to stop unfamiliar drivers and asks them to pick her up.  Your task as a software developer is to help Lina make her trips more convenient and safe.
